<p>
This page presents different types of visualization of the corpus
metadata (i.e., information about sources and materials), such as
tables, figures, graphs, and word clouds. These materials are
organized by type of metadata. The table below provides a list of
the types of metadata collected for composers, works, premieres
(first public performance of a work), and the extracted examples.
To explore the visualizations, click on the categories below the
table.
