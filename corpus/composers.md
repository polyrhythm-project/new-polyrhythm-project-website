				<p class="card-text">The timeline graph represents the lifetime (shown as green bar) of each of the twenty composers featured in the corpus, listed chronologically by birth year (Leoš Janáček, 1854, to Benjamin Britten, 1913), representing a total time range of 1854 to 1992 (shown with blue stars). Although the corpus includes pieces representative of each of the creative periods of the composers' lifetime up to 1969, works were selected with the focus period of 1900-1950 (shown with double-sided orange arrow). The graph allows the viewer to identify the composers' creative periods that fall within this focus period. For example, the focus period corresponds to Claude Debussy's (1882-1918) middle to late period, while it corresponds to Benjamin Britten's (1913-1976) early to middle period. The focus period also captures some composers' entire creative output, such as that of George Gershwin (1898-1937) and Arthur Honegger (1892-1955). The alignment of composers' lifetime and their creative periods also suggests possible encounters between composers as well as familiarity with other composers' output.</p>

				<h5 class="category mb-2 card-title">Death Region or Country</h5>
				<p class="card-text">When considering the corpus by composers' death countries, we see a clear shift to the United States as the most shared country. This shift is in part related to the exile of many composers during World War II, and includes European-born composers Béla Bartók, Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, and Edgard Varèse. When considering the American-born composers Aaron Copland, Charles Ives, and George Gershwin, this corresponds to seven out of 20 composers (35%) with the United States as death country. The <a hrep="https://maps.polyrhythm.humdrum.org/composers/#3/51.90/-9.77">composers map</a> provides another visual representation of this shift as well as other intercontinental movements. </p>
