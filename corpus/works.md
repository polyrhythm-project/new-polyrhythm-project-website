				<p class="card-text">The word cloud present corpus source works by composers. We can observe that the corpus is most strongly represented by a greater number of works by the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinů and the German-born composer Paul Hindemith, while the works of George Gershwin are the least represented. While this may be related to some bias on the part of Suter, it is a;lso related to his sampling method, which involved taking into account the compositional output of each composer. Thus, more works were sampled for composers with a larger output than for composer with a smaller output.</p>

				<p class="card-text">This graph provides a percentage comparison of works surveyed against works sampled and extracted examples. The percentages are based on the total number of works and examples in the corpus. As in the works by composers word cloud, Martinů and Hindemith have the highest percentages in all categories, although the percentage of extracted examples for Martinů is lower than the number of works surveyed and sampled. The graph also shows that the percentage of extracted examples is much higher than the surveyed and sampled works for the French composer Olivier Messiaen. This is the result of the large number of examples (20) extracted from <i>Turangalîla</i>, a Symphony for Solo Piano, Ondes Martenot and Orchestra (Mes-22). A similar pattern can be observed for the extracted examples from the German composer Alban Berg and the American composer Charles Ives. These differences may be related to those composers' more frequent use of polyrhythmic structures as a compositional technique.</p>
