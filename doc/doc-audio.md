Audio files were created for the purpose of analysis and experimentation. Metadata was extracted from commercially available recordings on [Naxos Music Library](https://www.naxosmusiclibrary.com/login). Because of copyright restrictions, these are not shared on the website. However, references to the recordings used are available on the Recordings page with links to the Naxos Music Library catalogue (subscription required). Sibelius recordings were generated based on the initial encoding using the software and used as an audio aid in the early stages of analyis. In addition to errors and omissions, the quality of the sythetic audio does not fully represent the timbre and performance markings included in the score. High-quality audio files were also created by composers in the research team using musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) rendered with the [EastWest Sounds](https://www.soundsonline.com/) to be posted alongside corpus examples on the website. The tempo of the synthetic examples was set to match the notated beat rate, The tempo of synthetic examples was set without rubato or expressive microtiming (i.e., the timing of individual note onsets or releases). In cases where there was no notated tempo, the average tempo of each example was calculated based on a human recorded performance randomly selected from the Naxos Music Library, and audio files were trimmed using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to allow excerpts’ duration to be more precisely measured. Synthetic examples were fine-tuned in terms of MIDI note velocity (i.e., volume of each note) and articulations (legato vs. staccato for piano, but a wide variety of options for strings) to match the human performances as closely as possible. The precise timing of raising and lowering the sustain pedal was also fine-tuned for piano excerpts. To match the acoustics of the human recordings as closely as possible, reverb was added to the piano examples using Logic’s Space Designer; it was not deemed necessary to add reverb to the string quartet examples, which fairly closely matched the acoustics of the human performances. A 0.2 s fade-out was applied to the end of each example to reduce the abruptness of the ending, and audio files were amplified or attenuated to a peak volume of -1 dB.

Examples that feature voice were transcribed using wind instruments that most closely matched the vocal timbre of the randomly selected commercial recording, whenever possible.
