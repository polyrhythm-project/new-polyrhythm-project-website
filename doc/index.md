## Metadata ##


The corpus examples are associated with different types of metadata (see Table 1, in [Poudrier &amp; Shanahan 2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LRTjYO4-_HYG4SMHygSoDHgLSHD840Zm/view?usp=sharing)). The metadata is stored on a Google spreadsheet from which the website metadata is extracted. This set-up allows for effortless updating of website metadata. Metadata was used in the transcription and encoding process as well as for analysis purposes. Metadata validation was performed by team members under the supervision of the principal investigator. Editorial comments pertaining to each example can be accessed on the corresponding example page. Click on the items below for more details on each metadata field pertaining to composers, works, premieres, and examples.

<summary style="display:list-item !important"> <span><b>Composers</b></span></summary>


The _Suter 1980 Corpus_ features twenty composers from Europe and North-America. Basic biographical information was collected using authoritative sources, including [Oxford Music Online](https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/), scholarly editions of the composers&#39; works, and scholarly biographies. Of special interest in this corpus is the emigration of several composers due to two world wars in the period covered. A map of composers&#39; birth and death cities can be accessed on the [Maps](/maps) page.



- Composer&#39;s Name
- Composer&#39;s Nationality
- Composer&#39;s Birth Date and Birth Place
- Composer&#39;s Death Date and Death Place

<summary markdown="1" style="display:list-item !important"> <b>Works</b> </summary>


The examples in this corpus were extracted by Suter (1980) from 450 works that were selected among 913 works surveyed.  The surveyed works were not selected based on their use of polyrhythm, but on their representation of each composer&#39;s output in terms of life period and genre. Each work is identified by Suter&#39;s Work ID, which consists of a three-letter abbreviation of the composer&#39;s last name and a number, which corresponds roughly to its composition year. A list of composers and their corpus representation by works and examples is accessible on the [Composers](/composers) page.


- Work Title
- Genre and Subgenre
- Composition Year
- First Publication Year

<summary markdown="1" style="display:list-item !important"> <b>Premieres</b></summary>


Because of the historical and geographical features of the corpus, information about work premieres was gathered using multiple sources, including internet resources. Geocoding of premieres venues or cities was used to create a heat map and an interactive timeline of the corpus using Carto. The maps can be accessed from the [Maps](/maps) page.

Each example is identified with a filename adapted from the original Suter examples IDs, which are visible on the E0 scores accessed through each example page. The filenames begin with &quot;R&quot; (reserve dataset) or &quot;T&quot; (testing dataset), followed by the example number used in Suter (1980) and a translation of the original Suter example ID. Please read this [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fzA7iakBfjbyc_Fwsnhsdmyk0lMiCAMp/view?usp=sharing) for more details on how to decode the Suter examples IDs.


- Source Work
  - Source Work Full Unit (SWFU)
  - Full Unit Total Measures
  - Full Unit Duration
  - Full Unit Start Time Signature and Time Signature Type
    - The start time signature were extracted from published scores and categorized using standard types (duple, triple, compound, or odd). If the work features changing time signature, only the start time signature was extracted; works without a time signature were categorized as &quot;none&quot;
    - Polymetric times signature were further categorized as &quot;polymetric&quot; (same notated beat has same duration) or &quot;polydurational&quot; (same notated beat has different duration)
  - Full Unit Start Tempo Expression
  - Full Unit Start Notated Beat, Notated Beat Rate, and Mean Beat Rate
