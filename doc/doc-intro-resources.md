The process of metadata collection and encoding was supported by a series of guides and protocols prepared by the project team. Guides include "how to" documents on decoding Suter's Example IDs, getting access to online scores, and transposing instruments. Protocols include detailed step-by-step procedures for research assistants to gather and validate metadata, preparation of reference scores, editorial editing, and audio preparation.
