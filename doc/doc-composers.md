The _Suter 1980 Corpus_ features twenty composers from Europe and North America. Basic biographical information was collected using authoritative sources, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com">Oxford Music Online</a>, scholarly editions of the composers’ works, biographies, and online sources. Of special interest in this corpus is the emigration of several composers due to two world wars in the period covered.

A map of composers’ birth and death cities can be accessed on [composers map](https://maps.polyrhythm.humdrum.org/composers/#4/49.43/10.40) page. Composer nationalities are provided on the [Composers](/composers) page. On the [browse](/browse) page, works and examples can be sorted based on the composer's last name.
