Because the source works are wide-ranging in terms of length and larger form, a source work full unit (SWFU) was determined based on the shortest complete unit. Works composed as a single movement are categorized as “single movement”. If the work was part of a collection of similar works (e.g., song cycle), the full unit is identified as the specific work within the collection, including the number assigned to the work within the collection, is applicable.

For multi-movement works like symphonies and sonatas, the movement is the full unit; movements are generally identified by their number and initial tempo marking. In larger works divided into sections that are composed of multiple units, such as operas and cantatas, the full unit was determined to be indicated by changes of scenes; scenes are generally identified by headings from the score, or when no heading is provided, by the text incipit. In cases where movements are not clearly separated from each other, the full unit was determined based on clues provided on the score by the composer or standard subdivision of the work in commercial recordings.

Below is a description of the procedure for extracting metadata from source works. Information pertaining to specific works is provided in the Editorial Comments available on each example page.

- Full Unit Total Measures and Duration
  - Total measures are provided based on the printed score; in cases where the full unit corresponds to a section within a work in which measures are not provided, a measures count is provided.
  - Dotted bar lines are not counted as measures unless measure numbers on the score treat dotted bar lines as full measures. In the case of polymetric scores, the smaller measures are counted, unless notated measure numbers are based on the larger notated measures.
  - Full unit duration is provided in the format “min:seconds” and calculated from 0:00 to the first second of silence at the end of the unit, unless it is part of a track that begins earlier. In the latter case, duration is computed by adding the recorded time of both tracks.

- Full Unit Start Time Signature and Time Signature Type
  - The start time signatures were extracted from published scores and categorized using standard types (duple, triple, compound, or odd). Works that are written without a time signature are categorized as “none”.
  - Polymetric time signatures are given in the order they occur, from bottom to top staff, and delimited by a semi-colon (e.g., 3/4;9/8). Polymetric time signatures are further categorized as “polymetric” (the same notated beat has the same duration) or “polydurational” (the same notated beat has a different duration).

- Full Unit Start Notated Beat, Notated Beat Rate, and Mean Beat Rate
  - If the beat rate is written as a range, a mean beat rate was calculated for analysis purposes. If two beat rates are given, with the second in parentheses, both beat rates are provided (e.g., “92(96)” and a mean beat rate is calculated. Polymetric beat rates are given in the order written and delimited by a semi-colon (e.g., quarter=60;dotted-quarter=40).
  - The absence of notated beat rate is signaled by the term “none” for each metadata field.

- Full Unit Start Tempo Expression
  - Tempo expressions were extracted from the first measure of the score in their literal form; the absence of tempo expression is signaled by the term “none”.
