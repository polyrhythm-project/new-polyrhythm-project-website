The corpus examples are associated with different types of metadata
(see Table 1, in [Poudrier &amp; Shanahan,
2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LRTjYO4-_HYG4SMHygSoDHgLSHD840Zm/view?usp=sharing)).
The metadata is stored on a Google spreadsheet from which the website
metadata is extracted. This setup allows for effortless updating
of website metadata. Metadata was used in the transcription and
encoding process as well as for analysis purposes. Metadata validation
was performed by [team members](/people) under the supervision of
the principal investigator. Editorial comments pertaining to each
example can be accessed on the corresponding example page. Click
