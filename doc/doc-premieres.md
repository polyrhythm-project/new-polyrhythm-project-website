Because of the historical and geographical features of the corpus, information about work premieres was gathered using multiple sources, including internet resources. Premiere metadata is provided on the example page whenever available.

Works were geocoded based on venue or city using the heat map format as well as an interactive timeline map using <a target="_blank" href="https://carto.com">Carto</a>. These maps include work, example, and premiere metadata, and can be accessed from the [maps](/maps) page. On the [browse](/browse) page, works can be sorted based on premiere year.
