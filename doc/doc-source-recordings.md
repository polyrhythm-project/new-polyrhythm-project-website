Recordings were randomly selected from the <a target="_blank" href="https://login.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fubc.NaxosMusicLibrary.com">Naxos Music Library</a>), available through the <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.library.ubc.ca">UBC Library Indexes & Databases</a>. The following procedure was used: (1) determine the number of available recordings in Naxos using the "composers" index, then "view by work," and then "available recordings"; (2) select recording using a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.random.org">random number generator</a> with max limit set to the number of available recordings (min limit = 1) and record random selection number (e.g., 14/35); (3) access selected recording and collect CD reference information; (4) record date retrieved and assign direct link through OpenAthens proxy.

- Naxos Recording Link
  - Access to source recordings is possible through an OpenAthens or institutional subscription.
  - In cases where an example spans more than one track, the recording link corresponds to the track that features the beginning of the example.

- Example Start and End Timestamps
  - Start and end timestamps are provided to facilitate users’ access to extracted examples within the source work full unit. They are extracted from the track player at the unit level of a second and are not rounded up. For example,  if an example starts at 1:00:95, the example’s start timestamp is 1:00, not 1:01; if the example ends at 1:00:95, the example's end timestamp is 1:00, not 1:01). In short, the time notated in seconds considers the full second, not a fraction of the second.

- Example Duration
  - Example duration is calculated from the extracted clips that include the full examples using a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).
