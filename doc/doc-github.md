The digital scores formats follow steps in the encoding process. Each example was first transcribed using [Sibelius Notation Software](https://www.avid.com/sibelius) and then exported as musicxml to be converted to Humdrum data (kern) using Verovio Humdrum Viewer(https://verovio.humdrum.org/). After conversion to Humdrum, data files underwent fine editing and two additional stages of review by different encoders. As a consequence, sibelius and musicxml data files may include errors and omissions.
