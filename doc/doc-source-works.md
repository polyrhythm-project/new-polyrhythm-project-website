The 724 examples presented in Suter (1980) are extracted from 450 works. The works are identified by a three-letter abbreviation of the composer’s last name followed by a number that corresponds roughly to its composition year within the specific composer’s output. Work numbers are not necessarily contiguous, possibly due to the fact that the 450 source works are a subset of 913 works surveyed by Suter. The surveyed works were not selected based on their use of polyrhythm, but on their representation of each composer’s output in terms of life period and genre. last name, and a number, which corresponds roughly to its composition year.

A list of composers and their corpus representation by works and examples is accessible on [composers](/composers) page. On the [browse](/browse) page, works can be sorted based on ID, title, genre/subgenre, composition year, and publication year.


- Work Title
  - Suter’s (1980) work titles are French translations of the original titles. The titles used on this website are based primarily on the published scores and include instrumentation; work titles are provided in the original language, followed by an English translation, whenever applicable.
  - Works are also identified by the work identifiers provided by Suter (1980). Work identifiers begin with a three-letter abbreviation of the composer’s last name followed by a number.

- Genre and Subgenre
  - Genre and subgenre were determined based on instrumentation, using Oxford Music Online composers’ works tables only as a secondary reference due to the lack of standardized category in this source.
  - Genre comprises “Orchestral” (with or without solo part), “Instrumental” (a subset of instruments), “Vocal” (excluding stage works), and “Stage”. Each genre is subdivided into subgenres to allow for finer distinction. “Orchestral” includes “Symphonic”, “Programmatic”, and “Concerto”, while “Stage” includes “Opera”, “Ballet”, and “Theatrical”. Due to the large proportion of solo keyboard works, “Instrumental” is subdivided into “Keyboard” and “Chamber” (including chamber orchestra). “Vocal” is subdivided into “Solo”, which includes only solo voices with accompaniment or as part of a duet, and “Choral” (with or without accompaniment, including orchestral).

- Composition Year and First Publication Year
  - Suter’s metadata was used as a starting point and cross-referenced with multiple sources, including Oxford Music Online, published scores and publishers’ websites, and bibliographies (printed and online). In cases where work was revised or orchestrated at a later date, the original completion date is provided first, with the revision date (“rev.”) or orchestration date (“orch.”) provided in parentheses. For works that exist in multiple versions, version information is provided in the Editorial Comments available on the example page.
