One of the most widely observed responses to music listening is the spontaneous moving of one's head or foot along with the "beat." This phenomenon is linked to an almost unique human ability to detect regularity in auditory signals. A fundamental property of rhythmic regularity is that it can unify individuals through joint action, contributing to social cohesion and community building. However, musical cultures around the world are characterized by extremely complex rhythmic patterns that are often very difficult to follow. This project seeks to deepen our understanding of the human experience of complex musical rhythms by examining "polyrhythm," the superposition of contrasting rhythms that present more than one beat simultaneously. While polyrhythms are widespread around the world, this project focuses on a corpus of examples of notated Western music that affords a geographically- and historically-informed analysis of the development of polyrhythm. Originally assembled by Louis-Marc Suter (1980), the corpus features music composed during the first half of the twentieth century, a period during which the use of complex rhythms increased significantly.
