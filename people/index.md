    <td>I am an Assistant Professor in music theory at the School of Music of the University of British Columbia, where I teach courses on compositional practice in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, techniques of graphic linear analysis, and music psychology. My research has been presented in interdisciplinary conferences in North-America, Europe and the Middle East, and published in Music Perception and Empirical Musicology Review. My current projects focus on the experience of listening to polyrhythm and the cognition of complex rhythmic structures, combining methods of close study, computer-aided musicology, and corpus studies.</td>

As a white settler, Walker has benefitted from the ongoing act of colonization in both the United States and Canada, and would like to acknowledge that their upbringing and education has taken place primarily on the homelands of the Massawomeck, Manahoac, and Musqueam nations. Walker’s compositions have been performed throughout Europe and North America, including the Alba International Music Festival, and the Blackstad in Residence program. In 2019, Walker's Vandalia for string orchestra was selected as the audience favourite at The EAR classical concert in New York City.</td>
