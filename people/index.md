    <td class="topalign">I am an Assistant Professor in music theory at the School of Music of the University of British Columbia, where I teach courses on compositional practice in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, techniques of graphic linear analysis, and music psychology. My research has been presented in interdisciplinary conferences in North-America, Europe and the Middle East, and published in Music Perception and Empirical Musicology Review. My current projects focus on the experience of listening to polyrhythm and the cognition of complex rhythmic structures, combining methods of close study, computer-aided musicology, and corpus studies.</td>

Walker is a doctoral candidate in composition at the University of British Columbia UBC), and they hold a MMus from UBC, and a BA from Shepherd University in West Virginia. As a white settler, Walker has benefitted from the ongoing act of colonization in both the United States and Canada, and would like to acknowledge that their upbringing and education has taken place primarily on the homelands of the Massawomeck, Manahoac, and Musqueam nations. Walker’s compositions have been performed throughout Europe and North America, including the Alba International Music Festival, and the Blackstad in Residence program. In 2019, Walker's Vandalia for string orchestra was selected as the audience favourite at The EAR classical concert in New York City.</td>

    <td class="topalign">A recent graduate from UBC with a MMus in Composition, Daniel is interested in the intersections between music and theatre. He employs elements of extended techniques, extra-music elements, and improvisation to discover this space. Concerned with what he observes every day, music helps him to explore social issues and approach them through sound.  His work encompasses various Percussion Ensemble pieces, works for String Quartet, Chamber Ensemble, solo works, and stage performance. He has had his works performed at the Canadian Music Centre, the West Coast Composer’s Symposium, the Student Composer concert series both at UBC and at Wilfrid Laurier University, as well as with the Kitchener-Waterloo composer collective The Yacht Club. In his future he plans to explore pitch triggered audio/MIDI with the Marimba in addition to a continued focus on pertinent issues like climate change, and the rising rate of poverty.</td>
