Twenty composers are represented in the <i>Suter (1980) Corpus</i>.  Click
on a table heading to sort the table by that column (click
twice to reverse the sort order), or click on an entry to browse
works/examples for that composer.  Mouse-over the birth and death dates
to see birth and death places. Also see the <a
href="https://maps.polyrhythm.humdrum.org/composers/">composers
map</a>, which displays birth, death and intermediate locations
in the life of the composer.
