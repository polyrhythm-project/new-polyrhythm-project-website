# Maps #


The Suter (1980) Corpus is represented by three interactive maps:

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://epoudrier.carto.com/builder/74c170e5-eaf8-4b2c-8569-155af79d8f58/embed">Composers</a> &mdash; The locations of birth and death for the twenty composers surveyed in this study 

2. <a target="_blank" href="https://epoudrier.carto.com/builder/8fac6c78-605d-421a-ade2-8a1a2f0d2f6f/embed">Heatmap</a> &mdash; A heatmap of the location of the first performance of the works

3. <a target="_blank" href="https://epoudrier.carto.com/builder/b5f7b654-fd92-443b-b6aa-26804492b148/embed">Timeline</a> &mdash; An animated timeline of the location of the first performance of the works


## How to use the maps ##


There are many ways to interact with the maps. You can zoom in and
out to regions of interest or use the search box on the lower
left-hand side to instantly zoom to a location. You can then click
on points the map to reveal more information. For example, clicking
on a point on the "Composers" map will show you the composer,
country, city, and date of birth or death associated with the
location. Clicking on a point on the "Heatmap" or "Timeline" will
bring up all kinds of information about the work, from year of
composition, to who was the conductor at the premiere, and even the
venue where it was premiered! You will also find the score and
recording (if available) of the 724 examples featuring polyrhythms
extracted from the 450 works.

On the right-hand side of each map, you will find filters to control
what is displayed on the map. For example, you can choose to show
only works by certain composer(s), or works from certain genre(s)
of interest, or even specify the name of a piece. If preferred, you
can also use the search boxes to explore more works. There is one
special filter at the very bottom that shows you whether the examples
from each work belongs to our Reserve Dataset, our Testing Dataset,
or Both. As you navigate the map, notice how these filters are
updated with the works shown on the screen.

A special feature about the "Timeline &ndash; Premiere Date" map is that
you can pause or resume the animated timeline, as well as click and
drag on it to display only the works pertaining to a selected period.
Hovering on its histogram bars will show you the number of works
premiered each year.
