# Maps #


The Suter (1980) Corpus is represented by three interactive maps:

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.polyrhythm.humdrum.org/composers/composers-map/composers-map.html#4/53.01/9.75">Composers</a> &mdash; The locations of birth and death for the twenty composers surveyed in this study 

2. <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.polyrhythm.humdrum.org/corpus/corpus.html">Corpus</a> &mdash; The locations of the first performance of the works in the corpus

3. <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.polyrhythm.humdrum.org/timeline/timeline-1.html">Timeline</a> &mdash; An animated timeline of the location of the first performance of the works


## How to use the maps ##

NOTE: These maps are preliminary versions of the final maps, which are still under development.

There are many ways to interact with the maps. You can zoom in and
out to regions of interest or use the search box on the lower
left-hand side to instantly zoom to a location. You can then click
on points the map to reveal more information. For example, clicking
on a point on the "Composers" map will show you the composer,
country, city, and date of birth or death associated with the
location. Clicking on a point on the "Corpus" or "Timeline" will
bring up information about the work, from year of
composition, to who was the conductor at the premiere, and even the
venue where it was premiered! You can then look for the score and
recording (if available) of the examples using the search boxes on the "Home" page.

On the right-hand side of each map, you will find filters to control
what is displayed on the map. For example, on the "Composers" map, you can choose to show
only certain composer(s). The slider on the "Timeline" map allows you to select a specific time range for premiered works. The diagram above the slider gives an overview of premiered works by decade,
