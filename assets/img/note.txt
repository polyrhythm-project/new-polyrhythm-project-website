Todo: create map.jpg at a resolution of 2400 pixels, which should be
about 10 times smaller than current map.svg iamge (

map.svg has four image, three of which are not used:
	one: current background as PNG
	two: old background as JPG
	three: same as current background but not used
		has white borders so not exactly the same as main map.svg
	four: possibly original image, unrelated to display and not used

Also has a possibly older unrelated SVG image of map which is smaller which should
be deleted when found.
