## Browse

The Browse page can be used to explore the corpus and access specific examples, including a range of examples that features selected characteristics. There are many different options for sorting and selecting examples, including a general search box, feature buttons, and range boxes. For each search action, the total number of examples that match the search criteria is shown above the table. To reset the table, click on the "Clear" button on the top right. To acess the How to use page again, click on the question mark button ("?") next to the "Clear" button. Clicking on a specific example will bring you to that specific example page. If you selected a range of examples, you can browse from one example to the next or previous example by using the back and forward arrows on the example page.

# Basic Options

There are two basic options for sorting the table.

Table headings: The table is organized by example identification tag ("ID"), composer's name ("Composer"), source work title ("Title), type of work ("Genre"), composition year ("Composed"), year of first public performance ("Premiered"), year of first publication ("Published"), notated beat and beat value ("Tempo"), time signature notated on the score at the start of the example ("Start time signature"), and duration in seconds of the example bases on a human performance from a commercial recording of the source work selected randonly from available recordings on the Naxos Music Library [link to website] ("Example duration"). You can click a column heading once to sort in default order; click again to sort in reverse order. 

Search box: Search for examples using keywords.

# Features

The feature buttons are set to "all" by default. Click on the down arrow for sorting options.

Examples: This is the only current option to access the music data. Visit the website again for the "Works" option.

Datasets: The corpus is organized in two datasets. The "Reserve" dataset is comprised of stratified random sample of 80 examples (4 examples for each of the 20 composers) that was used for the first series experiments. The "Testing" dataset is comprised of the remainder examples.

Composers: The corpus is comprised of examples extracted from works by twenty composers. Selecting a specific composer will list all corpus examples extracted from works by that composer.

Genres: Source works are categorized by genre and sub-genre. On the first level, there are four genre types and each genre is associated with a number of sub-genres. Selecting a first-level genre will render all the examples in that genre, including the examples in the associated sub-genres. Selecting a second-level genre, will render only the examples in that sub-genre.

Tempo beat types: The note value that represent the score's notated beat. Selecting a note value will render all the examples with the corresponding notated beat.

Time signature types: The time signature of the extracted example. Types are defined based on the two numbers of the time signature. First-level categories are based on the beat level and its relationship with the subdivisions, i.e., simple, compound, unequal, and other. Second-level categories are based on the number or type of subdivisions. electing a first-level type will render all the examples of that type, including the examples in the associated seconmd-level types. Selecting a second-level type, will render only the examples of that type.

Instrument: All examples are encoded with the name of the instrument for each part. Selecting a sepcific instrument will render all the examples that feature that instrument as part of an ensemble. By clicking on the "only" checkbox, youcan limit the search to examples that feature only that instrument (e.g., organ). Note that selecting this option will not always render examples, as some instruments are featured only as part of an ensemble (e.g., there are no examples that feature only accordions or banjos).

Class: Instruments are organized in classes [link to documentation]. Selecting a class will render all the examples that feature an instrument from that class. By clicking the "only" checkbox, you can limit the search to examples that feature only instrument from that same class (e.g., strings).
