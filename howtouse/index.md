## Browse Page

This page can be used to explore the corpus and access specific examples, including a range of examples that features selected characteristics. There are many different options for sorting and selecting examples, including the table headings, search box, features buttons, ranges boxes, and delimiting checkboxes. For each search action, the total number of examples that match the search criteria is shown above the table. To reset the table, click on the "Clear" button on the top right. To acess the "How to use" page again, click on the question mark button ("?") on the right of the "Clear" button. Clicking on a specific example in the table will bring you to that specific example page. If you selected a range of examples, you can browse from one to the next or previous example page by using the back and forward arrows on that example page.

# Basic Options

There are two basic options for sorting the table.

<ul><li><b>Table headings:</b> The table is organized by example identification tag ("ID"), composer's name ("Composer"), source work title ("Title), type of work ("Genre"), composition year ("Composed"), year of first public performance ("Premiered"), year of first publication ("Published"), notated beat and beat value ("Tempo"), time signature notated on the score at the start of the example ("Start time signature"), and duration in seconds of the example bases on a human performance from a commercial recording of the source work selected randonly from available recordings on the Naxos Music Library [link to website] ("Example duration"). You can click a column heading once to sort in default order; click again to sort in reverse order.</li>

<li><b>Search box:</b> Search for examples using keywords.</li></ul>

# Features

The features buttons are set to "all" by default. Click on the down arrow for sorting options.

<ul><li><b>Examples:</b> This is the only current option to access the music data. Visit the website again for the "Works" option.</li>

<li><b>Datasets:</b> The corpus is organized in two datasets. The "Reserve" dataset is comprised of stratified random sample of 80 examples (4 examples for each of the 20 composers) that was used for the first series experiments. The "Testing" dataset is comprised of the remainder examples.</li>

<li><b>Composers:</b> The corpus is comprised of examples extracted from works by twenty composers. Selecting a specific composer will list all corpus examples extracted from works by that composer.</li>

<li><b>Genres:</b> Source works are categorized by genre and sub-genre. On the first level, there are four genre types and each genre is associated with a number of sub-genres. Selecting a first-level genre will render all the examples in that genre, including the examples in the associated sub-genres. Selecting a second-level genre, will render only the examples in that sub-genre.</li>

<li><b>Tempo beat types:</b> The note value that represent the score's notated beat. Selecting a note value will render all the examples with the corresponding notated beat.</li>

<li><b>Time signature types:</b> The time signature of the extracted example. Types are defined based on the two numbers of the time signature. First-level categories are based on the beat level and its relationship with the subdivisions, i.e., simple, compound, unequal, and other. Second-level categories are based on the number or type of subdivisions. electing a first-level type will render all the examples of that type, including the examples in the associated seconmd-level types. Selecting a second-level type, will render only the examples of that type.</li>

<li><b>Instrument:</b> All examples are encoded with the name of the instrument for each part. Selecting a sepcific instrument will render all the examples that feature that instrument as part of an ensemble. By clicking on the "only" checkbox, youcan limit the search to examples that feature only that instrument (e.g., organ). Note that selecting this option will not always render examples, as some instruments are featured only as part of an ensemble (e.g., there are no examples that feature only accordions or banjos).</li>

<li><b>Class:</b> Instruments are organized in classes [link to documentation]. Selecting a class will render all the examples that feature an instrument from that class. By clicking the "only" checkbox, you can limit the search to examples that feature only instrument from that same class (e.g., strings).</li></ul>

# Ranges

You can sort example by range based on a number of characteristics, including tempo, duration, staff count, composition year, premiere year, and publication year. Each characteristic includes two text boxes (minimum and maximum) that require a number entry. You can set only a minimum, only a maximum, or a minimum and maximum. The number of examples that matech you selection criteria will appear above the examples table.

## Polyrhythm Example Page

Each example page present basic metadata about the example, including example and work identifiers ("Example ID" and "Work ID"), source work title ("Work title"), measures numbers for the extracted example ("Starting measure" and "Ending measure"), genre and sub-genre to which the source work belongs ("Genre"), composer's full name ("Composer"), date at which the work was completed ("Composition date") and first published ("Publication date"), date of first public performance ("Premiere date"), and extent information about the first public performance's venue ("Premiere location").

# Visualization Options

The corpus examples have been encoded with the texture divided into two contrasting rhythmic groups, and users can interact with the examples using the buttons above on each example page. If you want to browse through a range of examples using the same settings, select the range of example on the <a href="https://maps.polyrhythm.humdrum.org/browse">Browse</a> page and simply navigate to the next or previous example using the left and right arrows at the top. Once a combination of options have been selected, you can browse through the selected range of examples withjout having to re-select the same options.

Composite rhythms can be obtained for the full texture ("composite" option), coinciding events across parts ("coincidence" option), or for a combination of parts ("group" option renders Group A and Group B composite rhythms). Coincidence rhythm can ve viewed below the score or without the score ("analysis only" option). Groups can be colored on the score ("group color" option for Group A and Group B events, and "mark" option for coincidence events) and in the composite rhythm ("comp. color" option). Coincidence events are colored in green, Group A events are colored in red, and Group B events are colored in blue. The number of events in each composite rhythm can be viewed on the left side of the composite rhythm with the "event counts" option.
