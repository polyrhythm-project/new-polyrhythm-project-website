Each example page present basic metadata about the example, including
example and work identifiers ("Example ID" and "Work ID"), source
work title ("Work title"), measures numbers for the extracted example
("Starting measure" and "Ending measure"), genre and sub-genre to
which the source work belongs ("Genre"), composer's full name
("Composer"), date at which the work was completed ("Composition
date") and first published ("Publication date"), date of first
public performance ("Premiere date"), and extent information about
the first public performance's venue ("Premiere location").

# Reference scores

Each example is associated with one or more graphic representation. E0 referes to the example as presented in Suter's (1980) dissertation. Other scores (E1 through E4) are the published score excerpt that were used as reference for encoding. 

The encoding of the examples followed the diplomatic process, i.e., encoding was based on the E0 representation. Information obtained through consultation of otger published sources is also shown on the transcription in square brackets. Tempo information calculated based on the randomly selected recording of the source work is shown in squigly brackets.

# Analysis options

The corpus examples have been encoded with the texture divided into
two contrasting rhythmic groups (Group A and Group B, with Group A
assigned to the group that includes the lowest staff by default).
Users can interact with the examples using the buttons above on
each example page. If you want to browse through a range of examples
using the same settings, select the range of example on the <a
href="https://polyrhythm.humdrum.org/browse">Browse</a> page and
simply navigate to the next or previous example using the left and
right arrows at the top. Once a combination of options have been
selected, you can browse through the selected range of examples
without having to re-select the same options.

The options described below can be used in a variety of combinations
and afford a wide range of purposes.

<ul><li><b>group:</b> Click on this button to visualize the composite
rhythms for Group A and Group B below the score; click again to
undo.</li>

<li><b>group color:</b> Click on this button to color the notes in
the score that belong to Group A (in red) and Group B (in blue);
click again to undo.</li>

<li><b>composite:</b> Click on this button to obtain a composite
rhythm of the full texture below the score; click again to undo.</li>

<li><b>comp. color:</b> Click on this button to color the events
in the composite rhythm (Group A events in red, Group B event in
blue, and Coincdence events in green); click again to undo.</li>

<li><b>coincidence:</b> This option randers the composite rhythm
of the coinciding events across parts below the score; click again
to undo.</li>

<li><b>mark:</b> Click on this button to visualize the coincidence
events on the score (in green); click again to undo.</li>

<li><b>event counts:</b> Clicking on this button will render the
composite rhythm and the number of events it comprises on the left
below the rhythm label. If you want to see the number of events in
one or more of the other composite rhythms, click on the desired
option first, and then click on "event counts". To undo, click a
second time.</li>

<li><b>only analysis:</b> First select the composite rhythm(s) you
want to, then click on this button to view the composite rhythms
without the score.</li></ul>
