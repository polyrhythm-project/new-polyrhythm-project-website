The browse page can be used to explore the corpus and access specific
examples, including a range of examples that features selected
characteristics. There are many different options for sorting and
selecting examples, including the table headings, search box,
features buttons, ranges boxes, and delimiting checkboxes. For each
search action, the total number of examples that match the search
criteria is shown above the table. Clicking on a specific example in the table will
bring you to that specific example page. If you selected a range
of examples, you can browse from one to the next or previous example
page by using the back and forward arrows on that example page. 

To reset the table, click on the "Clear" button on the top right. To access the "How to use" page
again, click on the question mark button ("?") on the right of the "Clear" button. 

# Basic options

There are two basic options for sorting the table.

<ul><li><b>Table headings:</b> The table is organized by example
identification tag ("ID"), composer's name ("Composer"), source
work title ("Title), type of work ("Genre"), composition year
("Composed"), year of first public performance ("Premiered"), year
of first publication ("Published"), notated beat and beat value
("Tempo"), time signature notated on the score at the start of the
example ("Start time signature"), and duration in seconds of the
example bases on a human performance from a commercial recording
of the source work selected randonly from available recordings on
the Naxos Music Library [link to website] ("Example duration"). You
can click a column heading once to sort in default order; click
again to sort in reverse order.</li>

<li><b>Search box:</b> Search for examples using keywords from ID,
Composer, Title, and Genre.</li></ul>

# Features

The features buttons are set to "all" by default. Click on the down arrow for sorting options.

<ul><li><b>Examples:</b> This is the only current option to access
the music data. Visit the website again for the "Works" option.</li>

<li><b>Datasets:</b> The corpus is organized in two datasets. The
"Reserve" dataset is comprised of stratified random sample of 80
examples (4 examples for each of the 20 composers) that was used
for the first series experiments. The "Testing" dataset is comprised
of the remainder examples.</li>

<li><b>Composers:</b> The corpus is comprised of examples extracted
from works by twenty composers. Selecting a specific composer will
list all corpus examples extracted from works by that composer.</li>

<li><b>Genres:</b> Source works are categorized by genre and
sub-genre. On the first level, there are four genre types and each
genre is associated with a number of sub-genres. Selecting a
first-level genre will render all the examples in that genre,
including the examples in the associated sub-genres. Selecting a
second-level genre, will render only the examples in that sub-genre.</li>

<li><b>Tempo beat types:</b> The note value that represent the
score's notated beat. Selecting a note value will render all the
examples with the corresponding notated beat.</li>

<li><b>Time signature types:</b> The time signature of the extracted
example. Types are defined based on the two numbers of the time
signature. First-level categories are based on the beat level and
its relationship with the subdivisions, i.e., simple, compound,
unequal, and other. Second-level categories are based on the number
or type of subdivisions. electing a first-level type will render
all the examples of that type, including the examples in the
associated seconmd-level types. Selecting a second-level type, will
render only the examples of that type.</li>

<li><b>Instrument:</b> All examples are encoded with the name of
the instrument for each part. Selecting a sepcific instrument will
render all the examples that feature that instrument as part of an
ensemble. By clicking on the "only" checkbox, youcan limit the
search to examples that feature only that instrument (e.g., organ).
Note that selecting this option will not always render examples,
as some instruments are featured only as part of an ensemble (e.g.,
there are no examples that feature only accordions or banjos).</li>

<li><b>Class:</b> Instruments are organized in classes [link to
documentation]. Selecting a class will render all the examples that
feature an instrument from that class. By clicking the "only"
checkbox, you can limit the search to examples that feature only
instrument from that same class (e.g., strings).</li></ul>

# Ranges

You can sort example by range based on a number of characteristics,
including tempo, duration, staff count, composition year, premiere
year, and publication year. Each characteristic includes two text
boxes (minimum and maximum) that require a number entry. You can
set only a minimum, only a maximum, or a minimum and maximum. The
number of examples that matech you selection criteria will appear
above the examples table.
